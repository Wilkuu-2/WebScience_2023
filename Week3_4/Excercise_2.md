# A: A plot of the top 100 youtube videos 

**Plot here** 

## Network effects
When looking at the daily views (dV/dt) 
we can see that the daily views seem to stay around the same position relative 
to the songs more and less viewed by them. This implies that the daily viewership is related to the 
total amount of views. 
The songs daily viewership seems to stabilize somewhere under 0.4e7 viewers per day as they get less popular over time
Either because it gets old, being surpassed by new music or people overplaying it.

Additionally when plotting 


## Compared to the regular network effect model

### Differences
- In this analysis of music preferences we observe multiple products and how popular they are
- This analysis is about milions of people making choices instead of a prediction
- A single person can play a song multiple times a day
- The amount of views might be related to other things like the popularity of the platform or the amount 
  of time people have to listen to music each day.
- Some of the songs are made by artists who also have popular songs

### Similarities 
- Both have a visible influence of popularity 
- In the regular model and in the songs model, there is a equilibrum price, but in the case of the songs, it varies per day 
- 

##  Metrics
- Intrinsic interest r(x): 
    Amount of total time spent on youtube listening to songs when the song is played x times 
    
- Network benefit f(z):
    The popularity of the song or the expectation thereof. 
    This can be influenced by views, subscribes, comments and like-dislike ratios
    In addition, because of the youtube algorithm, popular songs get recommended more 

- Reservation price p*: 
    The amount of time people have to listen to songs, fluctuates day from day

### Another metrics that might affect r(x)
This mostly depends on taste, but also might be dependent on the likes and dislikes ratio of the video

### Another metrics that might affect f(z)
The popularity of the artist. Some artists have multiple songs in the top 100, like Drake etc. 
This is because people who listen to song made my an artist might listen to the artist's other songs 
because they liked the first song.
The youtube algoritm and it's recommendations


### Another metrics that might affect p*
Day of the week. People have more time on the weekends.
